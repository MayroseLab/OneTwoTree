OneTwoTree is an online tool designed to aid researchers with the task of phylogeny reconstruction. OneTwoTree allows a fully automatic phylogeny reconstruction, while providing researchers with the ability to fine-tune various steps of the analysis. Given a list of taxa names, OneTwoTree retrieves all sequence data available in NCBI GenBank for the requested taxa, regardless of which loci are available. Optionally, OneTwoTree can identify an appropriate outgroup to be included in the analysis. A clustering procedure is then performed to assign sequences to orthology groups that form the basis for the subsequent alignment and tree reconstruction steps. The user can obtain the list of sequence clusters or reconstruct the phylogeny using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian tools.

Recently we added an option to download a VDI file to run a virtual-machine on your personal computer. In the OTT_Manual_v1.1 you can find detailed instructions for:

Virtual-Box installation.
Local installation of the pipeline and its dependencies.
